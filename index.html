        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a 23 year-old student at the University of Caliornia, Riverside, and I am the youngest of three siblings. I am a Korean-American born to two South Korean born immigrants who came to the United States of America for some reason, even though I've been told that our family was not poor. Even though I am born to two South Korean natives, I honestly still do not really know that much of my maiden country's history or language for that matter which has kind of confused me at times because I honestly did not know how to identify myself. I really don't know to this day if I should call myself American or Korean-American because I live in America and more "American" than I am Korean. School was never the place where I excelled the most, nor was it the place where I would call myself comfortable. However, I was forced to go there because of laws and rules, and also my parents wanting me to be successful. Thus, I began my 13 year long journey starting as a three-year-old preschooler to being a high school graduate with no idea what to do in the future.<br><br>

        Ever since preschool, I never had the best of relationships with my teachers or any authority figure at school. That's probably why I never want to talk to them or even want to listen them teach because, looking back at it now, they sucked at teaching. I really don't remember the last time the last time that I actually feel like I learned something in grade school. The only subject I thought I actually learned was in History, but that is only because I don't know how anyone could learn about history without actually knowing what to learn about. College was where I actually felt like I was learning for the first time and not being read a powerpoint or a paragraph in a book.<br><br>

        My first job at Best Buy really confirmed that working sucks. Every aspect of the job sucked and it made me feel like every person at Best Buy knows abosolutely nothing about what they are trying to sell. However, when I started my job at a small family owned resturant, I started to actually see what a job was and not just waiting to see if I will be able to make money. Ever since, jobs have been fine and I just want a job for money.
